IVIS is developed by [Zhigang Lu](mailto:zhigang.lu@sanger.ac.uk), with the power of <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a> and <a href="https://highcharts.com">HighCharts</a>. Although it can be used as a general chart editor, it's more powerful when you need to visualise and analyse large datasets, e.g., RNA-seq data. Please note that this is only for academic use.

If you find it useful for your research, please cite as:
